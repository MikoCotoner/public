## Description

In this project, we propose to make a mobile version of the classic turn-based board game ‘Battleship’. We plan on replicating the game into mobile devices with the element of multiplayer in order for players to challenge each other. The user would launch the app, it would then ask the user to log in if it’s their first time. Otherwise, it would just load into the home screen straight away. If a user would like to play, they would press the ‘Find Game’ button and the game would create a lobby with another player.

Battleship is a board game played by two players in which, they try to guess the location of their opponent’s ships. Battleship can either be played on the standard battleship board or simply pen and paper. Each player has two 10x10 grids labeled A-J vertically and 1-10 horizontally. One grid is for positioning the player’s ships and recording the opponent’s attacks. A second grid is for where the player records their own shots. The player's grids are hidden from the other player.

Pins show whether or not the player’s attacks have successfully struck the opponent's ships or not. The white coloured pin suggests the player missed their attack and the red coloured pin suggests the attack was successful. At the start of the player’s turn, they would choose a position in the grid and place a pin on the location they chose.

Each player has a set of ships that they can strategically place in their box. Before the game starts, the players are given the following ships each: A single ship five squares long, a single ship four squares long, two ships three squares long and a single ship two squares long. Each player secretly positions their ships on their grid either vertically or horizontally.

A player wins the game once they destroy all of their opponent’s ships.

## Division of work
**Both**
* System Design
* Game Development
* Networking
* Testing

**Melvin**
* Log-in Database

**Mikolaj**
* Mobile Implementation
---
## Programming Languages
**Unity (C#)**: Developing the game and exporting to mobile device.

**Node.js**: For servers.

---

## Programming Tool(s)
**MySQL**
* Database to store user's log-in credentials and information.
---

## Learning Challenges
* **Unity C#**: We are unfamiliar with using the Unity game developer, especially how it uses C# but due to the near similarities of C# and Java, we feel a bit more confident about this learning challenge.
* **Log in Database**: We have no experience with creating a log-in database and would have to look up for tutorials online and how to do so. Also, this is our first time using the Google Cloud Platform.
* **Node.js**: We have would have to learn JavaScript and how to use Node.js.
